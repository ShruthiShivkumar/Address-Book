The Address Book Project is a console-based application written in the C programming language that allows users to manage and organize their contacts efficiently. This application provides essential functionalities such as adding new contacts by entering usernames, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, and searching for existing contacts by name, phone number, or e-mail address. It also enables users to edit and update contact details based on specific parameters like name, phone number, or email address, and offers the ability to delete contacts similarly. In addition to these core features, users can list all contacts stored in the address book and save their data to a file for future access, ensuring data persistence. The application also includes an exit option to terminate the program gracefully.

This project showcases key C programming concepts, including standard input/output for user interaction, input parsing for handling and validating user data, and file operations for storing and retrieving contact information.
